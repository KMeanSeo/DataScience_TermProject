# Data Science Term Project (Student Data Analysis Project: Sleep Patterns and Productivity)

## Comprehensive Report
### Key Findings Summary
This Project integrates and processess three independent datasets to analyze the multi-faceted correlations between student's sleep patterns, productivity, and stress levels, building a preprocessing, model train, predict and evaluate pipeline from end to end. There are 893 lines of Python code implement the pipeline lifecycle from data preprocessing to model evaluation, leveraging 15 regression models and 20 classifiers for multivariate analysis. Notably, the feature engineering stage combines over 30 scikit-learn components to imporve data quality.

## Project Scale Analysis
### 1.1 Codebase Structure

- Total Lines of Code: 893 (including 127 lines of comments)
- Modularity: Divided into 23 Jupyter notebook cells, with 10 custom functions
- Data Processing Pipeline: Parallel preprocessing for 3 independent datasets (student, productivity, efficiency)

### 1.2 Data Processing Complexity
```
# Example: Merging multiple datasets
column_mapping = {
    'physical_activity': 'exercise_frequency',
    'exercise_mins/day': 'exercise_frequency',
    # ... (8+ column mapping rules)
}

```
- Integrated Features: Merged 3 datasets using 15 common columns
- Feature Engineering: 5+ data cleaning steps (missing value handling, categorical encoding, time conversion, etc.)
- Scaling Methods: Comparsion of 5 normalization techniques (RobustScaler, StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler, etc.)

## Techinical Skill Level Assessment
